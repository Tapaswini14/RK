Blockchain-based applications are secure and private, thanks to the use of strong authentication as well as encryption and validation. Mobile Apps developed with 100% Blockchain technology can improve data privacy which makes apps more secure. Its encryption technique is considered impassable as all data is encoded and stored with a cryptographic hash. Blockchain has the potential to take mobile applications to the next level of security and accountability, particularly in industries such as financial technology (fintech) and healthcare.
